# Stacks and Queues
Implement the linked list concept and insertion.

## Challenge

Implement a Queue using two Stacks.

**Features** 
  - Create a brand new PseudoQueue class. 
  - This PseudoQueue class will implement the standard queue interface (the two methods listed below), but will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects. Ensure that you create your class with the following methods:
    * enqueue(value) which inserts value into the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
    * dequeue() which extracts a value from the PseudoQueue, using a first-in, first-out approach.
  - The Stack instances have only push, pop, and peek methods. You should use your own Stack implementation. Instantiate these Stack objects in your PseudoQueue constructor.

## Approach & Efficiency
Created the node then a stack and queue classes with all required methods then tested if the methods work properly.
