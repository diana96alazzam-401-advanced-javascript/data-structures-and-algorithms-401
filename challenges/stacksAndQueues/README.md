# Stacks and Queues
Implement the linked list concept and insertion.

## Challenge

Create a Stack classes list with these features:

**Features** 
 - A Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.
 - Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
 - This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to top when the stack is created.
 - A method called push which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.
 - A method called pop that does not take any argument, removes the node from the top of the stack, and returns the node’s value. 
 - Should raise exception when called on empty stack
 - A method called peek that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located on top of the stack, without removing it from the stack.
 - Should raise exception when called on empty stack
 - A method called isEmpty that takes no argument, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.

Create a Queue classes list with these features:

**Features** 
 - A Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.
 - This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to front when the queue is created.
 - A method called enqueue which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.
 - A method called dequeue that does not take any argument, removes the node from the front of the queue, and returns the node’s value.
 - Should raise exception when called on empty queue
 - A method called peek that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located in the front of the queue, without removing it from the queue.
 - Should raise exception when called on empty queue
 - A method called isEmpty that takes no argument, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the queue is empty.

## Approach & Efficiency
Created the node then a stack and queue classes with all required methods then tested if the methods work properly.
