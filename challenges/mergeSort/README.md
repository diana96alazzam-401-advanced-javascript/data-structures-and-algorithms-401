# Merge sort
Sorting algorithim.

## Challenge
Use the merge sort algorithm to sort an array.

## Approach & Efficiency
- Overall time complexity of Merge sort is O(nLogn). It is more efficient as it is in worst case also the runtime is O(nlogn).
- The space complexity of Merge sort is O(n). This means that this algorithm takes a lot of space and may slower down operations for the last data sets.
