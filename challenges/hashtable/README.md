# Implementation: Hash Tables
Hash Tables implementation.

## Challenge

**Features**
- Implement a Hashtable with the following methods:
    * add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
    * get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
    * contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
    * hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.

**Structure and Testing**
- Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.
