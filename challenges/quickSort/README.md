# Quick sort
Sorting Algorithm.

## Challenge

Follow the pesudo code and trace the quick sort algorithm to sort arrays.

## Approach & Efficiency
On average, the quick sort algorithm takes `O(nlogn)` comparisons to sort `n` items. In the worst case, it makes `O(n2)` comparisons, though this behavior is rare.
